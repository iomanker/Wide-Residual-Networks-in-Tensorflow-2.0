## Wide Residual Networks in Tensorflow 2.0
### Notice
This network is created by **[titu1994/Wide-Residual-Networks](https://github.com/titu1994/Wide-Residual-Networks/)**. I only modified these few code into Tensorflow 2.0 Library.
### Usage
If you want to use this code, just import this file.
```python
from wide_resnet import WideResidualNetwork as wresnet
```
I also attached a Cifar10 [demo](https://github.com/iomanker/Wide-Residual-Networks-in-Tensorflow-2.0/blob/master/wres-cifar10-demo.ipynb) on Jupyter Notebook.
